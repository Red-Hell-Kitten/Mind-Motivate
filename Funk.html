<p>Depression and anxiety is a pain in the fucking ass. There are many factors that can lead to the development of these disorders. Some you may already know, for example, trauma, stress, chemical inbalance, etc. Many people think geting out of a depressive state is easy, but fuck no. It would be easier to get Trump to stop being racist, honestly though, depression can be a bitch to deal with but here are a few tips to help with kicking it's freeloading ass to the curb.</p>

<h4>Sleep</h4>

<p>Hun, if you want to say bye to depression and anxiety you better catch some Zs! Lack of sleep can cause depression to worsen which can cause insomnia. That is a bad spiral to start falling down. I know that going to sleep can seem impossible, but with some will power you can train yourself to fall a sleep at a decent time. Depend on your age the amount of sleep you need will vary. Young children and adults need about eight to ten hours to stay happy and healthy as of where teens need about ten to twelve hours of sleep to stay healthy inside and out. So put down your tech or use a blue screen filter like f.lux or twilight!</p>

<h4>Socialize</h4>

<p>Studies have shown that isolating yourself can cause you start a downward spiral. So what should you do? Quit being anti-social and make friends or if you already have friends make plans with the so you aren't sitting in a dark room contemplating why. I've been there, that is no fun. I would honestly rather socialize, make memories, relax, and have fun. You are only young once so you might as well enjoy it while you can. Plus having friends can make you feel less alone in the world and can make you feel like you can handle situations you usually can't because you have support.</p>

<h4>Self-Care</h4>

<p>The final thing I am going to add to this list is self-care. You can't expect to be strong enough to kick depression and anxiety to the curb if you aren't taking care of yourself. If you try to do so you will just end up worse than you were before. So take time to recharge so you can be stable mentally, emotionally, and physically. If you still are struggling talk to a medical professional and see what they have to say about your unique situation!</p>
